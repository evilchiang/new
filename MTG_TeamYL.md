### Serious Team Building

We have to agree on schedule. Events. Buying shirts. Play testing.

Trading, buying, selling cards as a unit.

Building decks as a unit.

And in extreme situations. Forfeiting a match for the sake of the team winning an event.

Like if we are at GP and a player on our team is going undefeated and we end up facing each other. We give up the match to improve his chances.
